# RustFS Console Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-First Architecture

Every feature must be built as reusable Vue 3 components using Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax. Components must be self-contained, independently testable, and follow single responsibility principle. Clear component interfaces required - no tightly coupled components that cannot be used independently.

**Rationale**: Ensures maintainable, scalable frontend architecture that supports the complex file management operations required by RustFS Console.

### II. TypeScript-First Development

All code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. No `any` types allowed without explicit justification. Type definitions must be comprehensive and exported for reusability. Vue components must use proper TypeScript integration with defineProps, defineEmits, and typed refs.

**Rationale**: Type safety is critical for enterprise file system management where data integrity and API contract compliance are paramount.

### III. User Experience Excellence

Every user interaction must be intuitive, responsive, and accessible. Support for multiple languages (i18n) is mandatory. Dark/light theme support required. Mobile-responsive design must work across all device sizes. Loading states, error handling, and user feedback must be comprehensive.

**Rationale**: File system management requires complex operations that must remain user-friendly for administrators of varying technical expertise.

### IV. Internationalization by Design

All user-facing text must use the i18n system from the start. No hardcoded strings in components. Support for RTL languages must be considered. Date, time, and number formatting must be locale-aware. New features must include translations for all supported languages (English, Chinese, Turkish).

**Rationale**: RustFS Console serves global enterprise customers requiring native language support for critical file system operations.

### V. Performance & Security

Bundle size must be optimized through code splitting and lazy loading. API calls must be efficient with proper caching strategies. Security headers and CORS must be properly configured. Input validation required on both client and server sides. Authentication and authorization must be robust and session-based.

**Rationale**: File system operations involve large data transfers and sensitive access controls requiring optimal performance and security.

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

- ESLint and Prettier must pass without warnings
- Vue TSC type checking must pass completely
- All components must have proper TypeScript definitions
- Composables must follow Vue 3 best practices
- No console.log statements in production builds

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests required for all utility functions
- Component testing for complex UI interactions
- Integration testing for API interactions
- E2E testing for critical user workflows
- Test coverage must be maintained above 80%

## Development Workflow

### Contribution Process

1. All changes must go through Pull Request review
2. Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
3. Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits specification
4. Code must pass all quality gates before merge
5. Breaking changes require documentation and migration guide

### Review Requirements

- TypeScript compilation must succeed
- All tests must pass
- UI changes require screenshot/video demonstration
- Performance impact must be assessed for large changes
- Accessibility compliance must be verified

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitution changes require:

1. Documented justification for the change
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase
3. Team consensus through formal review
4. Migration plan for affected code
5. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

### Compliance Review

- All Pull Requests must verify constitutional compliance
- Architecture decisions must align with core principles
- Complexity additions require explicit justification
- Regular audits of codebase against principles

### Version Control

- Constitution supersedes all other development practices
- Conflicts resolved in favor of constitutional principles
- Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance specific to Claude
- Regular reviews ensure principles remain relevant
